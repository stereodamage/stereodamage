## Hi there 👋

- 🇷🇸 I live in Belgrade, Serbia (GMT+1) (subject to change!)
- 🐍 I develop features at ToYou.
- 🤖 I write code for 7+ years, most of the time on Python. Sometimes Go and JavaScript.
- 🚀 I love open-source projects. Sometimes I try to contribute, but there is always little time.
- ✉️ You can shoot me an email at stereoad@proton.me.
